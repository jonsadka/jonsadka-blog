To start this script, we declare a global <code>reducedData</code> variable which will contain our final product. Right below this variable declaration we will use jQuery to import our data.json file and within that callback is where our data manipulation will occur. Once we are satisfied with how the data is formatted, we will set <code>reducedData</code> as the result of this operation as follows:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">// set the global variable\\nvar reducedData;\\n\\n// setup the jQuery function to fetch the local json file\\nvar modifyData = function(){\\n  $.getJSON('data.json', function(json){\\n    var result;\\n\\n    // modify data.json file and modify result;\\n\\n    // set the result to reduced data before leaving the callback\\n    // write yourself a message indicating that the script is finished\\n    console.log('All done making your data smaller and prettier!');\\n    reducedData = result;\\n  });\\n};\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>html component</h3>\\n<p>Now comes the fun, tricky part. We still have no easy way of running our <code>reducer.js</code> file and invoking modifyData. To accomplish this, we need to fool Chrome into thinking it’s communicating with a live server rather than our local machine because when developing locally, browsers often enforce strict permissions for reading files out of the local file system. First, lets create an <code>index.html</code> file so that Chrome has a page to navigate to. The following <code>index.html</code> file is sufficient and should also be placed in the same directory as <code>reducer.js</code>:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-html\\\">&#x3C;!DOCTYPE html>\\n&#x3C;html>\\n  &#x3C;head>\\n    &#x3C;meta charset=\\\"utf-8\\\">\\n    &#x3C;title>ReduceData&#x3C;/title>\\n    &#x3C;script src=\\\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js\\\">&#x3C;/script>\\n  &#x3C;/head>\\n  &#x3C;body>\\n    &#x3C;h3>Reduce The Data Please&#x3C;/h3>\\n    &#x3C;script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\" src=\\\"reducer.js\\\" charset=\\\"utf-8\\\">&#x3C;/script>\\n  &#x3C;/body>\\n&#x3C;/html>\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Server setup</h3>\\n<p>Next, we need to open up our terminal and navigate to the folder where our <code>reducer.js</code> file is. Once in that folder, we can run the following command to boot up a local server:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>python: <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888</code></li>\\n<li>python 3+: <code>python -m http.server 8888</code></li>\\n<li>php: <code>php -S localhost:8888</code></li>\\n<li>ruby: <code>ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8888</code></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Typically a message in the terminal will notify us to navigate to <code>0.0.0.0:8888</code>. Open up chrome and navigate to either <code>0.0.0.0:8888</code> or <code>localhost:8888</code>; you should see \\\"Reduce The Data Please\\\".\\nbring it all together</p>\\n<p>Now, open up the Chrome console (<code>command</code> + <code>option</code> + <code>j</code>) and invoke <code>modifyData()</code>. Once the completion message \\\"All done making your data smaller and prettier!\\\"\\\" is displayed, type <code>copy(reducedData)</code> into the console and volla! your data is copied into the clipboard and you can paste this new data anywhere you please.</p>\\n<p>This is just a boilerplate reducer file and I often find myself adding additional arguments to <code>modifyData</code>.
