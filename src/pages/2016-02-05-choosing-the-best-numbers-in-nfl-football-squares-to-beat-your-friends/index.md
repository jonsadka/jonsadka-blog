### Explanation

What does this all mean? Let’s review how to play.

Football squares is a simple betting a game. To play, guess the last digit of each team’s score at the end of each quarter. It’s easy enough to play at the office, against your family or at a NFL Super Bowl party. But, make sure you do your research first.

To come up with the winning numbers for each quarter, we looked at all NFL game data since 2009. The full results can be seen in the visualization above. The x-axis denotes the last dig\it of the home team’s score while the y-axis denotes the last digit of the away team’s score.

So when your friends ask you to Football Squares this weekend, put your poker face on. You got this.
